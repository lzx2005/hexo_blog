# 会议排期管理


## 题目

最近看到一个ThoughtWorks的面试题，这边实现一下，问题如下：

**Problem Two: Conference Track Management**

You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

- The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
- Each session contains multiple talks.
- Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish before 12 noon, for lunch.
- Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
- The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
- No talk title has numbers in it.
- All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
- Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you don’t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

**Test input:**

```

```

**Test output:**

## 代码介绍

### 实体类

会议管理系统包含多个实体类

- Track : 负责记录每一天的行程，所有的排期，可以包含多个Track，也就是多天。
- Session : 负责记录每一天上午，或者下午(可以扩展比如晚上)，记录了总共可以分配的时间，剩余可用的时间，开始时间(早上是9点，下午是1点)以及Talk列表。
- Talk : 一次会议，包含的是会议标题，会议耗时。

![](ThoughtWorks的面试题-Conference-Track-Management解题思路/entities.png)

对于使用者来说，只需要进行一次`new Track()`操作，即可创建出一个包含`上午`和`下午`两个Session的Track，上午可用时间为180分钟，下午可用时间为240分钟，每一个Session生成了一个空的Talk List。

### 枚举类

- SessionType : 定义一个Session，包括Session总共可分配时间以及Session开始时间，使用LocalTime定义时分秒。

### 总流程类

- TrackService : 处理传递过来的Talk列表，分配时间，安排会议，翻译一个Track列表。

### 工具类

- FileUtils : 读取文件每一行，返回一个List<String\>

## 调用流程

1. 读取文件：

```java
List<String> list = FileUtils.read(new File(FileLaction.TEXT_FILE));
if (list == null) {
    throw new RuntimeException("file is null");
}
```

2. 生成Talk列表

```java
TreeSet<Talk> talks = new TreeSet<>(); //使用TreeSet是可以让列表以时间排序
list.forEach(title -> {
    Talk talk = new Talk(title);
    talks.add(talk);
});
```

3. 调用Service

```java
TrackService trackService = TrackService.getInstance(); //TrackService是单例的
List<Track> tracks = trackService.manage(talks);
```

4. 格式化输出

```java
for (int i = 0; i < tracks.size(); i++) {
    Track track = tracks.get(i);
    System.out.println("Track " + (i + 1) + ":");
    System.out.print(track.getMorning().toString());
    System.out.println("12:00PM Lunch");
    System.out.print(track.getAfternoon().toString());
    System.out.println("05:00PM Networking Event");
    System.out.println();
}
```

5. 得到结果

```java
Track 1:
09:00AM Communicating Over Distance 60min
10:00AM Ruby on Rails: Why We Should Move On 60min
11:00AM Writing Fast Tests Against Enterprise Rails 60min
12:00PM Lunch
01:00PM Rails Magic 60min
02:00PM Ruby on Rails Legacy App Maintenance 60min
03:00PM Overdoing it in Python 45min
03:45PM Ruby Errors from Mismatched Gem Versions 45min
04:30PM Programming in the Boondocks of Seattle 30min
05:00PM Networking Event

Track 2:
09:00AM Accounting-Driven Development 45min
09:45AM Pair Programming vs Noise 45min
10:30AM Clojure Ate Scala (on my project) 45min
11:15AM Common Ruby Errors 45min
12:00PM Lunch
01:00PM Woah 30min
01:30PM Ruby vs. Clojure for Back-End Development 30min
02:00PM Sit Down and Write 30min
02:30PM Lua for the Masses 30min
03:00PM User Interface CSS in Rails Apps 30min
03:30PM A World Without HackerNews 30min
04:00PM Rails for Python Developers lightning
05:00PM Networking Event
```
